# Some Useful Tricks Not Related To Programming

## Recover of lost text in working application 
When I were writing my first post (I did it in github webpage, editing - never do that as me ðŸ˜…) I accidentally clicked somewhere, making all the post disappeared.
I was shocked and did some tries to go back and forth, but it was gone. Thought a bit, I came up with idea that browser process could retain some pieces of text in memory, so I used installed HxD editor.
It was a pain to find some in chrome 20+ processes, but I managed to find one phrase I remembered and it worked! It took time, but I was able to recover almost all paragraphs. They were scattered in fragments, so consider to never do this in browser and use text editors.
